# ✔️ Palindrome-Checker
This is a two fold project.

## 1️⃣ Part One -> Algo(checker.js)
The first part of this project involves creating an algorithm that can check if a given string is a palindrome.

### 💭 General thought process for the Algorithim
1)Remove all non-alphanumeric characters.<br>
2)Turn that variable into all lowercase.<br>
3)We can't directly reverse the string, so we split the string, reverse, and then rejoin.<br>
4)Compare!<br>
5)Return true or false based on the comparison <br>

## 2️⃣ Part Two -> website

### 💭 General thought process for the Website
1) I pretty much chose it to be style wise identical to FCC as I wanted to focus on the JS.
2) After completing the HTML and CSS using my knowledge from the previous course, I did a deep dive on the JS.
3) Added a clickable event to the check button, check for input value. Check if its empty, if not, pass it to the palindrome function.
4) Return a result to result div and bold the first word using a span.

## 🎉 Project completed!

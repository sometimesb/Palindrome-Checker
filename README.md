# ✔️ Palindrome-Checker
This is a two fold project.

## 1️⃣ Part One -> Algo(checker.js)
The first part of this project involves creating an algorithm that can check if a given string is a palindrome.

### 💭 General thought process
1)Remove all non-alphanumeric characters.<br>
2)Turn that variable into all lowercase.<br>
3)We can't directly reverse the string, so we split the string, reverse, and then rejoin.<br>
4)Compare!<br>
5)Return true or false based on the comparison <br>
